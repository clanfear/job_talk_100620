  Start out with CE; its moved us forward

Insert new page 1: Core research question as anchor
Step in the components
  Make first diagram same shape as later
    Pop in controls at end
  Step in the data as I'm going; highlight BE
Statistical model do colors
Consider pop-ups in plots, like is informal social control only thing?

Verbal summary before plot of results

On results, box what I'm talking about.

Make more dynamic--think of one thing at a time; transitional stuff.

Need to see what dissertation is going to look like.

Show interesting questions, know how to answer them.
  Show logic of data and methods.

Cut down on data section

Put scholars in bullets, take out of talking.

Only say what is key, put other stuff in footnote

Maybe slide on key data -- SSO

What are questions at the start? Highlight which I'm looking at today, then repeat slide with answers before results slide.
  Break up prior results bullet slide

Palindrome: This is dissertation, this is what I'm doing, here are answers, here and caveats, here are next steps.
